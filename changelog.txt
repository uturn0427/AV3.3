they find any threats and need to clean them.  This automated reboot can be
aborted by pressing the (a) key

the (i) key. (Will be referred to as 'Options' menu hereafter)

   (10/2012/8/2008/7/VISTA/2003/XP/2000/NT)
  -Added Full System Backup to the Options menu, this includes Microsoft Product Keys
   (Windows/Office), Full Registry Backup, Full User Folder backup (All users data)
